# extensibleRenderer
> "Render extensibly"

## Reason
This piece of software is hard to explain, but the point of this program is to allow easy rendering. For example, image you are trying to make a yotube video your wallpaper. You would use a graphics plugin for youtube videos (built in) and an output plugin for a computer wallpaper (built in). Plugins are easy to use and are easy to create. More docs coming soon once this thing works!
