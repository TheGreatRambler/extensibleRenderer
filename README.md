# extensibleRenderer
# VERY EARLY STAGES, COME BACK LATER FOR A REAL IMPLEMENTATION!
> "Render extensibly"

## Reason
This piece of software is hard to explain, but the point of this program is to allow easy rendering. For example, imagine you are trying to make a youtube video your wallpaper. You would use a graphics plugin for youtube videos (built in) and an output plugin for a computer wallpaper (built in). Plugins are easy to use and are easy to create. More docs coming soon once this thing works!

## How to install
1. Get Pywinauto from GitHub
2. Later instructions to come...

## Plugins that will probably be implemented:
* [Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaciekBaron/BMLTrafficJS/master/index.html): 2e+25 is a cool rule
* [1D Cellular Automata](https://github.com/ogham/mindless-automata): Implement all 256 rules
* [Gray-Scott Model](http://pmneila.github.io/jsexp/grayscott/): Choose own color schemes
* Minecraft rendering! Using [window plugin](plugins/Gp_renderWindow.py) already included
* [Fractal Flame Algorithm](https://tariqksoliman.github.io/Fractal-Inferno/): Run on a shader probably
* [Chaos Game](http://rectangleworld.com/demos/ChaosGame/chaos_game.html)
* [Inconvergent](https://img.inconvergent.net/generative/): The work this guy does is fantastic
